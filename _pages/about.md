Hi, I'm Caroline! I am a Master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chelsea Finn and part of the Stanford IRIS lab.

My research interests lie in machine learning, with a focus on developing robust and trustworthy AI systems. I'm particularly fascinated by the challenges of adapting foundation models and understanding in-the-wild distribution shifts.

<!-- Feel free to add more personal statements or details about your research interests here -->

Previously, I did my undergraduate in mathematics (B.S.) at Stanford.
