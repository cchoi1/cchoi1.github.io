Hi! I'm Caroline, a Master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chelsea Finn and part of the Stanford IRIS lab.

My research interests lie in machine learning, with a focus on developing robust and trustworthy AI systems. 
Recently, I've worked on adapting foundation models to downstream tasks and understanding real-world distribution shifts.

<!-- Feel free to add more personal statements or details about your research interests here -->

Previously, I did my undergraduate in mathematics (B.S.) at Stanford.
