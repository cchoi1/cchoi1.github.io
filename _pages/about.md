Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University.
I am grateful to be supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).

Previously, I received a B.S. in Mathematics and an M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford, where I worked in [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/)'s [IRIS lab](https://irislab.stanford.edu).
Before that, I worked on number theory research at the [University of Virginia Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/reu/program), advised by [Charlotte Ure](https://about.illinoisstate.edu/cure/) and [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono/).
At Stanford, I served as Professional Development Chair of [Tau Beta Pi](https://tbp.stanford.edu/professional/) (Engineering Honors Society).

Please get in touch if you would like to chat about research!
